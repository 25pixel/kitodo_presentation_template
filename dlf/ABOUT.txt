Goobi Digital Library Suite
===========================

Goobi is an open source software suite intended to support mass digitization
projects for cultural heritage institutions. Goobi is widely-used and
cooperatively maintained by major German libraries and digitization service
providers.
Goobi consists of several independent modules serving different purposes such as
controlling the digitization workflow, enriching descriptive and structural
metadata, and presenting the results to the public in a modern and convenient
way.


About Goobi.Presentation
------------------------

Goobi.Presentation is a feature-rich framework for building a METS-based digital
library. It is highly customizable through an user-friendly backend and flexible
design templates. Since it is based on the great free and open source Content
Management System TYPO3 (http://typo3.org), it integrates perfectly with your
website and can easily be managed by editors. Goobi.Presentation provides a
comprehensive toolset covering all basic requirements for presenting digitized
book media.


About the naming of Goobi.Presentation
--------------------------------------

The Goobi Software Suite is used for digitizing huge amounts of books, journals,
newspapers, and other printed and hand-written material, and making it available
to the public. Thus Goobi helps collecting, archiving and providing knowledge to
everyone. This is a great task that inspired many writers of not only science
fiction and fantasy novels, too. Thus there are many brilliant stories in which
libraries or librarians play an important role.
We therefore decided to name each major release of Goobi.Presentation after a
fictional librarian from one of these novels who ideally shares our vision of
collecting and publishing the entirety of human knowledge one day (or at least
is an extraordinary remarkable character in the plot).

1.0: Horace Worblehat
Horace Worblehat is the Librarian of the Library of the Unseen University (UU)
in Terry Pratchett's fantasy series of "Discworld" novels.
Like the Bodleian Library at Oxford, the UU Library features chained books â€“
although at Oxford this is done to protect the books from the students, whereas
at UU it is done to protect the students from the books. The high concentration
of magical lore makes it possible for the Library to contain every book ever
written, possibly written, unwritten and yet to be written.
The Librarian appeared in the first novel of the series and was transformed into
an orang-utan by accident while handling a magical book in a later novel. On
discovering that being an orang-utan had certain advantages for a librarian - he
can climb up to high shelves, for example - he refused to be transformed back
into a human and has remained an orang-utan ever since.

1.1: Patterson Tchung
In Frank Herbert's book "Direct Descent" the 81st century Earth has been
hollowed out entirely and turned into a planet-sized library. The innards of the
Earth were used to construct a fleet of ships that colonized the stars while the
people who remained behind dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge.
They sent wave after wave of librarians out who collected knowledge, returned to
Earth, created programming about their discoveries and then broadcast those
programs to everyone in the universe for free.
The director of this library is (in the second part of the book) an intelligent
simian named Patterson Tchung.
